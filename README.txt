This is the first ever source code of Eksi Sozluk as of May 1999, my
first attempt at developing an interactive web application.

It kept the dictionary data in a plain text file. The original file
was 2MB long, I had to trim it. You should still be able to run this
code with existing stuff.

I also emptied the user database in user.txt to protect people's
privacy. One should still be able to add entries with "dummy" user
(password: "dummy").

The names show.txt and index.exe are still kept in today's Eksi Sozluk
as show.asp and index.asp respectively.
